                    <span class="default-highlight">I am a Full Stack Software Engineer from Sri Lanka with over four
                    years of hands-on experience</span> building web, blockchain, mobile, desktop,
                    and Linux-based applications. I am fluent in English and a native Sinhala speaker. My work spans the
                    full software lifecycle—from ideation and system design to development, deployment, and long-term
                    maintenance.

                <p class="default-p">
                    <span class="default-highlight">My journey into software development</span> began during my academic years, where problem-solving and
                    logical thinking naturally drew me toward programming. This curiosity led me to pursue a <span class="default-highlight">BSc (Hons)
                    in Information Technology specializing in Software Engineering at SLIIT,</span> where I strengthened my
                    foundations in computer science, software architecture, and real-world application development. As
                    part of my academic journey,<span class="default-highlight">I conducted research on real-time emotion detection and mental health
                    monitoring for remote employees, which was later published in an international journal—an experience
                    that deepened my appreciation for data-driven and impactful technology solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    <span class="default-highlight">Fast-forward to today</span>, I have had the opportunity to work with talented engineers and
                    cross-functional teams across multiple organizations. <span class="default-highlight">My professional experience includes building
                    secure full-stack web applications, RESTful APIs, real-time socket-based systems, mobile applications, npm packages , chrome extensions, Dapps, and Linux desktop
                    applications using technologies such as React, Next.js, Vite, Node.js, NestJS, Go, Flutter, and
                    Electron.js. I have also worked extensively with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis,
                    as well as embedded storage solutions such as Pebble DB and Badger DB.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    <span class="default-highlight">Beyond coding</span>, I have gained valuable experience in system design, secure authentication (JWT,
                    encryption), and DevOps practices. <span class="default-highlight">I have worked with Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, AWS,
                    DigitalOcean, and GitHub Actions to ensure reliable and efficient software delivery.</span> Leading and
                    mentoring junior engineers has helped me develop strong communication and leadership skills while
                    maintaining clean code practices and scalable architectures.

                <p class="default-p">
                    <span class="default-highlight">I strongly believe that DevOps and automation play a crucial role in modern software development.</span>
                    Streamlined workflows, efficient CI/CD pipelines, and reliable infrastructure directly contribute to
                    higher-quality software and better collaboration between teams. This mindset has shaped how I
                    approach both development and deployment—always aiming for performance, security, and
                    maintainability.

                    <span class="default-highlight">What truly drives me</span>, however, is curiosity. My passion for technology goes far beyond day-to-day
                    work. I genuinely enjoy debugging complex issues, exploring new frameworks, reading documentation,
                    and experimenting with emerging tools. Whether it’s building a side project, developing an NPM
                    package, or experimenting with a new stack, I am motivated by the challenge of learning and
                    improving continuously. I believe this curiosity not only sharpens my technical skills but also
                    helps foster a positive and collaborative team culture.

                <p class="default-p">
                    <span class="default-highlight">On a personal note,</span> I value purpose-driven work and community experiences. I enjoy documentaries,
                    science fiction and suspense movies, instrumental music, Linux environments, mathematics,
                    and meaningful discussions around philosophy and exploration. When I travel, I like to document my
                    experiences so I can revisit and reflect on them later.
